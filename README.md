## Project - Delay-Predictive Routing for Emulated Non-Terrestrial Networks 

**Objective:** Building an emulated Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) and evaluate delay-predictive routing and compare it against routing.

### Initial Set up 

- Create dynamic topology + NTN scenarios 
- Implement routing 
- Collect telemetry 

### AI/ML Implementation 

- Train regression model to predict near-future link/path delay 
- Integrate predicted delay into routing decisions 
- Run experiments 

After completing the following objectives, we can analyze the accuracy of our model compared to network performance trade-offs
